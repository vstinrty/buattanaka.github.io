        Your files. Your media. Your Khan Academy account. We know your password and email, and we can do whatever we want. <br><br>
        If you want your computer to have no virus, you must pay H.O.T. $1,000,000 dollars. You will be forced our of your house and live in starvation, thrist, and poverty.
        <br><br>
        Pay H.O.T. now. The police and government can't do anything. It is useless to call 911. We have blocked your phones to 911 and the government.
